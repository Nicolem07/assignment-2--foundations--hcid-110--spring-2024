    <h1>More About Me!</h1>
    <img src="img/IMG_7657 (2).jpg" alt="Picture of me!" height="515" width="386">
    <p> I have a goldfish called boxer and he's 1 year old. My friends got me him for Secret Santa and he's survived ever since.
      My favorite type of books are murder mystery. They manage to get me hooked super fast and I can never predict who the killer is.
      I am currently rooming with a good friend that I met at the start of the year and so far its been really great! </p>
    <p>Other activities I really enjoy are cooking, baking, swimming, and drawing.
      My favorite movie is Fantastic Mr Fox because I love stop motion animation and would love to be able to create a piece of art that everyone can enjoy.
      The cuisines I like the most are anything from South America, Chinese, Japanese, Italian, and Mexican.  </p>
